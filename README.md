Part of the [SkilStak Terminal Master configuration](https://gitlab.com/skilstak/config).

The `tmux` terminal multiplexer is a standard tool these days but keeping its usage compatible with the original `screen` has obvious objective benefits in terms of muscle memory. `screen` is on everything by default. `tmux` isn't.

This configuration also assumes you are a `vim` user/master.
